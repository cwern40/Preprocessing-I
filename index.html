        <h2>About Me...</h2>
        <p>I got into web development from my current job. I work for a software company as an account manager. I make custom changes for the clients that I manage and I do that through a proprietary coding language development by my company and also html. I really enjoyed coding and figuring out solutions to complex problems using code and so I decided to learn more about web development. I did a cheap online program through udemy working at my own pace. After doing that for several months I decided that I wanted to sign up with a program to make sure that I was learning industry best practices and building a solid foundation. That brings me to today where I am studying an Lambda School.</p>
